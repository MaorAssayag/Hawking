## A real-time communication system for deaf and blind people

### Short description
Hawking was created to help people with struggle to communicate via a braille keyboard.
This app enabling using TTS & STT calibrated with standard braille keyboard.
This project is part of a final computer engineering project in ben-gurion university Israel,
in collaboration with the deaf-blind center in Israel.


### Abstract

The increasing accessibility to today's smart technology enables the search for solutions for populations with different disabilities, such as deafness and blindness, to improve their lives. According to statistics, over 1400 Israelis have the dual disability of deaf-blindness, when the leading cause of deaf blindness in Israel is an incurable disease called "Usher syndrome".

Blind deaf people do not hear the blind or see the sign language of the deaf and therefore cannot fit into their company. Therefore, the deaf-blind are excluded from every framework, cut off from an accessible means of communication with the environment.

The purpose of this project is to develop a system that will enable verbal communication with the deaf-blind, thus relieving their loneliness and enhancing their independence. Today there is no technological solution available to this community, especially in Hebrew. Development of the system will emphasize accessibility to the Israeli community using the tools available to them, with an emphasis on meeting their daily needs.

The main idea is to develop an application on an Android device that will be connected to a standard Braille keyboard (or develop another medium according to needs). The application will be able to perform Speech-to-Braille and Braille-to-Speech operations accompanied with the appropriate accessibility indication that the conversation is well executed and continuous for both the speaker and the deaf-blind person.

The system's language and interface will be Hebrew, and the development process will be done in collaboration with the Deaf-blind center in Israel - Beit David Institute and in cooperation with the deaf-blind community in Israel.
