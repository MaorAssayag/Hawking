# Hawking
## A real-time communication system for deaf and blind people

### Short description
Hawking was created to help people with struggle to communicate via a braille keyboard.
This app enabling using TTS & STT calibrated with standard braille keyboard.  

This project is part of a final computer engineering project in ben-gurion university Israel,
in collaboration with the deaf-blind center in Israel.  

The project was chosen to represent the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering on the day of presentation of the final projects, and was also awarded one of the "The audience's favorite projects".

### Abstract

The increasing accessibility to today's smart technology enables the search for solutions for populations with different disabilities, such as deafness and blindness, to improve their lives. A deaf-blind person does not hear speech or see sign language,  therefore they are excluded from every framework, cut off from an accessible means of communication with the environment.

The main purpose of this project is to develop a system that will enable verbal communication with the deaf-blind, thus relieving their loneliness and enhancing their independence. Today there is no technological solution available to this community, especially in Hebrew. Development of the system will emphasize accessibility to the Israeli community using the tools available to them and on meeting their daily needs.

The system consists of an application on Android device which is connected to a standard Braille keyboard. The application performs Speech-to-Braille and Braille-to-Speech operations accompanied with appropriate accessibility indicators so that the conversation is understandable and continuous for both the speaker and the deaf-blind person.

The system's features and interface support English & Hebrew, and the development process was done in collaboration with the Deaf-blind center in Israel - Beit David Institute and the deaf-blind community in Israel.

Initial tests were performed with the deaf-blind community and the feedback were very positive and used to improve the application. Future work will be focused on porting the app for iOS and continue the design and development of a new portable braille keyboard that combines the layout of a standard keyboard (Write) and a braille display bar (Read) that can enable deaf-blind people to communicate more naturally and effectively.
